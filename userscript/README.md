# Original GitHub Navigation Bar Color

A Userscript that reverts the GitHub navigation bar back to it's original color. :octocat:

You can find the latest version of the Userscript [here](https://github.com/jackwilsdon/original-github-navigation-bar-color/releases/latest).

## Building

The Userscript is built using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) using the source of the Chrome extension found in the [extension](../extension) folder.

You can build the extension by first running `npm install` to install the dependencies required and then by running `npm run build`.

This should create a `userscript.js` containing the built Userscript.
